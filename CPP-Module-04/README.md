# CPP Module 04 — Virtual functions, abstract classes, and deep copies

This module introduces polymorphism through abstract base classes, virtual destructors, and correct deep-copy semantics for classes containing dynamic resources.

Exercises included (short purpose):

- `ex00/` — Basic `Animal`, `Cat`, `Dog` examples showing virtual methods and correct destructor behavior.
- `ex01/` — Adds a `Brain` class used by `Cat`/`Dog` to demonstrate deep vs shallow copy and copy constructors.
- `ex02/` — Builds on `Brain` usage, ensuring proper copy behavior and resource management in inheritance hierarchies.
- `ex03/` — AMateria / character / inventory example (extended polymorphism and interfaces). This exercise demonstrates abstract classes and runtime polymorphism.

How to build:

Use the `Makefile` inside each exercise folder.
