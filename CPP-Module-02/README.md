# CPP Module 02 — Fixed-point arithmetic and basic geometry

This module introduces fixed-point numeric representation, basic operator overloading, and small geometry utilities.

Exercises included (short purpose):

- `ex00/`, `ex01/`, `ex02/` — different stages of a `Fixed` class implementation: constructors, copy/assignment, comparison and arithmetic operators, and conversions between integer/float. Teaches operator overloading, copy semantics, and encapsulation.
- `ex03/` — `Point` and `bsp` (binary space partition / point-in-triangle) exercise. Teaches working with small geometry algorithms and using previously implemented `Fixed` class in practice.

How to build:

Each exercise includes a `Makefile`. Run `make` inside the exercise folder.
