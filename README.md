# CPP-Modules-42 — Exercise collection

This repository contains a sequence of C++ learning modules. Each `CPP-Module-0X` folder contains exercises (ex00, ex01, ...) that progressively teach C++ concepts.

Module index

- [CPP-Module-01](CPP-Module-01/README.md) — Pointers, dynamic allocation, and basic object behavior
- [CPP-Module-02](CPP-Module-02/README.md) — Fixed-point arithmetic and basic geometry
- [CPP-Module-03](CPP-Module-03/README.md) — Classes, inheritance and polymorphism basics
- [CPP-Module-04](CPP-Module-04/README.md) — Virtual functions, abstract classes, and deep copies
- [CPP-Module-05](CPP-Module-05/README.md) — More OOP patterns, operator overloading and exception handling
- [CPP-Module-06](CPP-Module-06/README.md) — Templates, iterators, and advanced container patterns
- [CPP-Module-07](CPP-Module-07/README.md) — Advanced features: STL, functors, algorithms
- [CPP-Module-08](CPP-Module-08/README.md) — Concurrency, networking, or system-level topics
- [CPP-Module-09](CPP-Module-09/README.md) — Final projects and integration exercises

How to use

1. Open the module folder you're interested in (for example `CPP-Module-03`).
2. Read the module README for a short explanation and the list of exercises.
3. Enter an exercise folder and run `make` to build and run the example.

Notes and next steps

- These READMEs are concise overviews. You can expand each exercise README with build examples, expected outputs, and testing instructions as needed.
