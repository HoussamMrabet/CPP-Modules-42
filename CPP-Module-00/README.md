# CPP Module 00 — Introduction to C++ and basic programs

This module introduces the very basics of C++: compilation with a Makefile, standard input/output, simple string handling and small programs that exercise the language fundamentals.

Exercises included (short purpose):

- `ex00/megaphone.cpp` — simple program that reads arguments and prints them in uppercase. Teaches command-line args and basic string operations.
- `ex01/Contact.cpp`, `PhoneBook.cpp`, `main.cpp` — simple phone book project. Teaches classes, basic data storage, and program flow.
- `ex02/Account.cpp` — small banking/account simulation. Teaches static members, simple class design and basic tests.

How to build:

Each exercise has a `Makefile`. From the exercise folder run `make`.
