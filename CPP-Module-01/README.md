# CPP Module 01 — Pointers, dynamic allocation, and basic object behavior

This module covers dynamic memory, object creation and destruction, and basic patterns for resource management in C++.

Exercises included (short purpose):

- `ex00/` — zombie creation helpers (`newZombie`, `randomChump`) and `main` to test. Teaches dynamic allocation and deletion.
- `ex01/` — `zombieHorde` factory function. Teaches arrays of objects and memory management.
- `ex02/` — simple main to test behavior and integration.
- `ex03/` — `HumanA` and `HumanB` examples showing reference vs pointer semantics when using a `Weapon` object.
- `ex04/` — `Sed` text manipulation exercise — teaches file I/O and string processing.
- `ex05/` and `ex06/` — `Harl` exercises demonstrating function pointers / method dispatch and class behavior.

How to build:

Each exercise contains a `Makefile`. Run `make` inside the exercise folder.
