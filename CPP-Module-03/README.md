# CPP Module 03 — Classes, inheritance and polymorphism basics

This module focuses on building classes, using inheritance, and practicing polymorphic behavior through simple game-like classes.

Exercises included (short purpose):

- `ex00/` — `ClapTrap` basic class. Teaches methods, attributes, and encapsulation.
- `ex01/` — Adds `ScavTrap` derived from `ClapTrap`, demonstrates simple inheritance and method overriding.
- `ex02/` — Adds `FragTrap` and more interactions; deepens understanding of derived classes.
- `ex03/` — `DiamondTrap` example combining multiple behaviors (multiple inheritance pattern used carefully). Teaches constructor order, virtual inheritance considerations and method resolution.

How to build:

Each exercise contains a `Makefile`. Run `make` inside the exercise folder.
