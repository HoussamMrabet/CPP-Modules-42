# CPP Module 07 — Advanced features: (STL, functors, algorithms)

This module typically focuses on the Standard Library usage, algorithm design, and applying more advanced C++ features to solve problems cleanly.

Exercises included:

- `ex00/`, `ex01/`, `ex02/` — (placeholders) Expect exercises that use STL containers, iterators, and algorithmic problem-solving.

How to build:

Each exercise includes a `Makefile` when present.
