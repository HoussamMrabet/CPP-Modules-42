# CPP Module 05 — More OOP patterns, operator overloading and exception handling

This module continues building on object-oriented design, covering common C++ idioms such as operator overloading, copy/move semantics, and basic exception safety.

Exercises included:

- `ex00/`, `ex01/`, `ex02/`, `ex03/` — (placeholders in this workspace) Typical exercises in this module implement classes that require careful resource management, define operators, and show how to design safe interfaces.

How to build:

Each exercise will have a `Makefile` where available.
